JSP and JSTL Online Shop Project with front and back offices in Oracle DB - Java BackEnd

In order to learn more quickly some of mandatory technologies that compose Anacom's core applications, I developed this fullstack Online Shopping Project Java backend in JSP with Oracle PL/SQL Database, JSTL framework and expression language over a MVC pattern with layers for division of responsibilities and more control.

With Bootstrap5 and FontAwesome for frontend presentation, the application permits the owner to register products and users in order to sell online thru its shopping cart. So, the admin receive orders and feedback from the customers for interaction logged in a backoffice page where it's possible to cancel/deliver orders and receive messages from customers of any kind of subject.

I hope you enjoy! Let me know about any question/feedback.
